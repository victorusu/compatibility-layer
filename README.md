# Compatibility layer

## Introduction

The compatibility layer of the EESSI project uses [Gentoo Prefix](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix)
to provide a known base on top of the host. This is the foundation we use to build our software stack on.
An alternative would be the [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

The bootstrap process will need a clean environment with C and C++ compilers (the system version of gcc and g++ will do) as well as the `make` command. It also is very sensitive to 
the environment, so setup a user with unset `CFFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and the always harmful `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variables.

EESSI provides a Singularity container for this.

### Building the Singularity container
The provided Singularity definition file can be used to build a container with a clean environment:
```
sudo singularity build bootstrap-prefix.sif singularity-bootstrap-prefix.def
```

### Bootstrapping Gentoo Prefix
Gentoo Prefix provides a bootstrap script to build the prefix, see [Gentoo Prefix Bootstrap](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix/Bootstrap).
We forked [this version](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/prefix.git/tree/scripts/bootstrap-prefix.sh?id=e77fd01734f21ec2e9c985c28ba4eb30c1b2bc9d)
and made some modifications. See issue [#8](https://github.com/EESSI/compatibility-layer/issues/8) for more details. 

You can run our version of the bootstrap script (see `bootstrap-prefix.sh`) inside the Singularity container by executing:
```
singularity run bootstrap-prefix.sif
```
or simply:
```
./bootstrap-prefix.sif
```

If you want to run your own version of the bootstrap script, use:
```
singularity exec bootstrap-prefix.sif ./bootstrap-prefix.sh
```

After starting the bootstrap have a long coffee...

### Adding EESSI overlay
Additional packages are added in the EESSI overlay, which is based on ComputeCanada.
To add the overlay: 

Start the prefix
```
startprefix
```
Ensure the configuration directory exists, with $(EPREFIX) the path to your prefix installation.
```
export EPREFIX=path/to/your/prefix
mkdir $(EPREFIX)/etc/portage/repos.conf
```
Configure the overlay. 
```
emerge eselect-repository
eselect repository add eessi git https://github.com/EESSI/gentoo-overlay.git
```
Sync the overlay
```
emerge --sync
```
